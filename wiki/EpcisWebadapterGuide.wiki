== About this Guide ==

This guide is intended to help users getting started with the Fosstrak EPCIS Webadapter module. The EPCIS Webadapter adds a RESTful, fully Web-enabled, API to a standard EPCIS repository. While the EPCIS Webadapter can be deployed on top of any standard compliant EPCIS Repository, this guide outlines the steps to follow in order to set up the EPCIS Webadapter to work with the Fosstrak EPCIS Repository.

*Please note that the EPCIS Webadapter is not an EPCglobal standardized interface and currently is still a beta Fosstrak module.*

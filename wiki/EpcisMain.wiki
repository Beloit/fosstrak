= Fosstrak EPCIS =

Fosstrak EPCIS provides an EPCglobal-certified EPCIS Repository as well as Query and Capture clients. In addition to these standards-compliant modules, it also offers a "Webadapter" for easy EPCIS access via web protocols (e.g., REST).

== Status ==

Fosstrak EPCIS is a complete implementation of the EPCIS standard specification (Version 1.0.1 of September 21, 2007). It successfully passed conformance testing and is [http://www.epcglobalinc.org/certification/ EPCglobal-certified].

== How can the Fosstrak EPCIS Project help you? ==

This project allows you to:

  * deploy an EPCIS Repository using our implementation
  * query an existing EPCIS Repository using our graphical user interface
  * fill an existing EPCIS Repository with EPC data using our graphical user interface

== Organization ==

The Fosstrak EPCIS Project comprises three separate modules:

  * an EPCIS Repository implementation
  * an interactive EPCIS Capture Application
  * an interactive EPCIS Query Application

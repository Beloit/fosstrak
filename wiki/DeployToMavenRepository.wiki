= Introduction =

This page illustrates how maven articfacts are deployed.


== Deploy existing artifacts ==

  * Adjust poms to list description, developer info and scm urls (otherwise sonatype nexus repo will complain during release process)
  * Install gnupgp if it is not already installed
  * Adjust your mvn settings.xml to include sonatype nexus repository credentials 
  * run mvn gpg:sign-and-deploy-file for the existing artifacts (see example below)
  * log into sonatype nexus oss repo at https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories
  * search for fosstrak 
  * browse and inspect files uploaded
  * click "close" button
  * click "release" button (with a small delay the artifacts are now available from the central repository)

== About these Tests ==

These tests should help you test your Fosstrak Filtering & Collection environment. The tests are wide spread, to cover most of the functionallity of the Filtering and Collection middleware.

To define a subscriber to subscribe to an ECSpec, a very simple way is to start and register an [AleUserGuideQuickStart Eventsink].

Basic tests with these files:

ReaderAPI
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/SimpleAPI.xml SimpleAPI]: One HALReader with LogicalReader1 connecting to it.

ECspecs
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpec.xml ECSpecCurrent],
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpecADDITIONS.xml ECSpecAdditions],
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpecDELETIONS.xml ECSpecDeletions],

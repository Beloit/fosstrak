== About these Tests ==

These tests should help you test your Fosstrak Filtering & Collection environment. The tests are wide spread, to cover most of the functionallity of the Filtering and Collection middleware.

To define a subscriber to subscribe to an ECSpec, a very simple way is to start and register an [AleUserGuideQuickStart Eventsink].

== Basic Tests ==

Basic tests with these files:

ReaderAPI
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/SimpleAPI.xml SimpleAPI]: One HALReader with LogicalReader1 connecting to it.

ECspecs
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpec.xml ECSpecCurrent],
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpecADDITIONS.xml ECSpecAdditions],
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpecDELETIONS.xml ECSpecDeletions],
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/simpletests/ECSpecADDITIONSandDELETIONS.xml ECSpecAdditionsAndDeletions]

Test Scenario:

1. Current
|| Define the ECSpecCurrent || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpecCurrent || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must appear in all Reports until Tag is removed from Shelf1 ||
|| Remove Tag from Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must not appear any Report from now on ||

2. Additions
|| Define the ECSpecAdditions || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpecAdditions || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must only appear in the first following Report ||

3. Deletions
|| Define the ECSpecDeletions || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpecDeletions || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must not appear in the Report ||
|| Remove Tag from Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must only appear in the first following Report ||

4. Additions & Deletions
|| Define the ECSpecAdditionsAndDeletions || ||	
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to the mentioned ECSpec || ||	
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must only appear in the first following Report ||
|| Remove Tag from Shelf1 of the HALReader || Tag must only appear in the first following Report ||

== Compatibility Tests ==

Compatibility tests with these !ReaderSimulators: 

ReaderAPI:
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/comptests/CompReaderAPI.xml CompReaderAPI]

RPReader:
  * Shelf: Shelf1, Shelf2
  * Readtime Interval: 1000 ms
  * Readduration: 500 ms
  * _notificationListenTimeout_25000/_notificationListenTimeout_

RPLogRd1:
  * connects to RPReader

!LogRd1:
  * connects to HALReader1

!LogRd2:
  * connects to HALReader2

CompLogReader
  * Composite Logical Reader, consitsting of !LogRd1 and RPLogRd1

ECSpec:
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/comptests/ECSpec1.xml ECSpec1] Connects to !LogRd1 only
  * [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/comptests/ECSpec2.xml ECSpec2] Connects to !LogRd1 and to !LogRd2
  * [[http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/comptests/ECSpecComp.xml ECSpecComp] Connects to CompLogReader

Test Scenario:

1. Change Sources

|| Define the ECSpec2 || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpec2 || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader2 || Tag must appear in Report ||

2. Change Spec

|| Define the ECSpec1 || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpec1 || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader2	|| Tag must not appear in Report ||
|| !LogRd1 disconnects from HALReader1; !LogRd connects to HALReader2 using this update for the LRSpec of the !LogRd1: [http://fosstrak.googlecode.com/svn/wikires/ale/testfiles/comptests/newLRSpecLogRd1.xml newLRSpecLogRd1] || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must not appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader2 || Tag must appear in Report ||

3. Update Spec

|| Define the ECSpecComp || ||
|| Define a subscriber, which subscribes to ECSpecComp || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the RPReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Update LRSpec of !CompReader: remove !LogRd1 using "removeReaders" || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must not appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the RPReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Update LRSpec of !CompReader: remove !LogRd1 using "removeReaders"; Update LRSpec of !CompReader: add LogRd2 using "addReaders" || ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the HALReader1 || Tag must appear in Report ||
|| Put one Tag on Shelf1 of the RPReader1 || Tag must not appear in Report ||
